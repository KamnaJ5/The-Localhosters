🌿 MAMA — Maternal Assistance & Monitoring Application
> "Assist, don't diagnose."
> An end-to-end digital companion providing supportive, continuous care from early pregnancy through delivery and the critical 42-day postpartum period.

📌 Problem Statement
Pregnancy and the postpartum recovery phase involve frequent clinical check-ins, evolving medication regimens, critical vital tracking, and significant shifts in physical and emotional wellbeing.
In many healthcare settings—especially across underserved communities—monitoring drops off steeply after hospital discharge. Critical records remain scattered across physical slips, language and digital literacy barriers impede timely logging, and early warning signs of complications or postpartum distress often go unnoticed until an emergency arises.
💡 Our Solution
MAMA bridges the post-discharge care gap by providing an accessible, continuous, and non-diagnostic tracking platform. Designed with low-bandwidth, voice-first, and multilingual capabilities, MAMA enables mothers and families to log symptoms, digitize paper prescriptions, track medication adherence, and generate structured clinical handoffs for healthcare professionals

💊 3. Prescription OCR & Medicines
 * Prescription Digitisation: Powered by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to parse medicine names, dosages, and frequencies from physical prescription slips.

📋 5. Doctor Brief (Clinical Handoff)
 * One-Tap Summary: Compiles recent vitals, symptom severity trends, and medication adherence into a clean, structured summary.
 * Print & Export Ready: Reduces clinical triage time during doctor consultations by replacing scattered paper slips with a cohesive health thread.

 * 
🤝 6. Support Circle & Gentle SOS Nudge
 * Consent-Driven Sharing: Opt-in sharing permissions for partners, family members, or designated caregivers.
 * Gentle Check-In Nudge: If persistent low mood or acute distress is logged over consecutive days, the app triggers a gentle notification to a trusted support person alongside hotlines for professional mental health support.
